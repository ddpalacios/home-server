**Observation:** 

In a music career, one of the biggest challenges is the ability to obtain a stable career with a livable and reliable income. To achieve such a goal requires a level of **discipline, consistency, and opportunity.**  For a practicing musician, it is more than just being able to play the notes. **The true value of a musician is the ability to connect with an audience, emotionally.** Achieving a level where musicians can play with passion varies by the individual, but the requirement would always be practice and consistency over the course of months to years.  Consistency is the most difficult part when learning a new skill set. Practice is not always the most entertaining and it includes repetitive actions on fundamentals. The value of mastering the fundamentals is the ability to be given any difficult piece and drastically **reducing the technical challenges and increasing the focus on playing with passion and emotion.** That is, where musicians can connect with an audience emotionally, but that requires consistency, and it is where most quit regardless of if their skills are truly exceptional than the average person. 


**Question**:


If there was an ability to visualize emotion through sound, could that create an audience that would continue to come back? Would practicing musicians be more inspired or motivated to keep practicing repetitive fundamentals without losing interest and quit?

**Hypothesis**:


If emotion can be visualized with sound, then it will establish an audience that would feel more connected with the musician resulting in an increase of reputation, popularity, confidence, and opportunity

-----
**Experiment(s)**:
1.	Record a simulation based on sound & emotion and expose it on social media
   
**Group A:** Plays a piece with simulations

**Group B:** Plays a piece without simulations


-	Both Groups play the same piece 
-	Both groups will share on the same social media apps
-	Both groups will have a similar reputation


**Tests:**
-	How many likes & shares does each group have? 
-	How many audience members keep coming back vs listeners?
-	How many come back because of the simulation vs without
