Question / Theory 

musicians and non-musicians often overlook the beauty and complexity that a single note can bring.  like Beethoven has stated, we can make mistakes, but what's worse is a mistake made without passion is unacceptable. 
There is lots of truth to that statement. What is passion? Lots of muscians have passion but often feel lost by what and how they are playing. 

What could we understand more deeply on how musicians play? 

Could we engage more people to create more music?
